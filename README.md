# Practical SQL - Personal notes

This repository is based on the book [Practical SQL, 2nd Edition](https://nostarch.com/practical-sql-2nd-edition). But instead of using PostgreSQL and some other tools used in the book to learn more about SQL, I decided to use Python, pandas and SQLite. Each chapter also has its own Jupyter notebook with the corresponding notes and exercises.
